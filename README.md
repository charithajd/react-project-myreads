# React Nanodegree Program
## My-Reads: A Book Tracking App

This is the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree programm.
This application allows you to search for books and place the selected books on to shelf. There are two pages: The Homepage shows the three bookshelfs, currently reading, want to read, and read. The search page will allow the user to search for books by title or author.

You must be connect to the Internet (the app access an external API).

1. [Clone](https://github.com/charithajd/react-project-myreads.git) this Repository or [Download](https://github.com/charithajd/react-project-myreads/archive/master.zip) the Zip File.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend.


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.


## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
